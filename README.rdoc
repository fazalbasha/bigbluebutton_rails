= BigBlueButton on Rails

 {BigBlueButton}[http://bigbluebutton.org] integration for Ruby on Rails 4. (For Rails <= 3.2, see versions <= 1.4.0.)

Features:
* Allows multiple servers and multiple conference rooms.
* Full API access using {bigbluebutton-api-ruby}[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton-api-ruby].
* Easy way to join conferences: simply create a room and call the <tt>join</tt> action.
* Easy integration with authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as {Devise}[https://github.com/plataformatec/devise] and {CanCan}[https://github.com/ryanb/cancan].
* Support for recordings: meetings can be recorded, the list of recordings retrieved and recordings can be played.
* Possibility to create private rooms, that require a password to join.
* Deals with visitors (users that are not logged), allowing (or forbidding) them to join rooms.
* Uses static meeting IDs generated as a globally unique identifier (e.g. <tt>36mskja87-029i-lsk9-b96e-98278407e145-1365703324</tt>).
* Stores a registry of meetings that happened and associates them with the recording that was generated for it (if any).
* Allows rooms to be configured dynamically using the <tt>{config.xml}[https://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/ClientConfiguration]</tt> feature.
* Automatic detection of the user-agent to automatically trigger the {mobile client}[https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-air-client] when joining a conference from a mobile device.

Possible future features:
* Limit the number of users per room and rooms per server.
* Server administration (use <tt>bbb-conf</tt>, etc).
* Pre-upload of slides.
* See {TODO.rdoc}[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/blob/master/TODO.rdoc].

== Supported versions

=== BigBlueButton

The current version of this gem supports <tt>all</tt> the following versions of BigBlueButton:

* 0.81: Altough not all features are supported yet. (See {TODO.rdoc}[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/blob/master/TODO.rdoc].)
* 0.8

=== Ruby

Tested in rubies:

Requires ruby >= 1.9.3.

* ruby-2.1.2 *recommended*
* ruby-1.9.3 (p484)

Use these versions to be sure it will work. Other patches of these versions should work as well.

=== Rails

To be used with <b>Rails 4</b> only.

Version 1.4.0 was the last one to support Rails 3.2. To use it, use the tag <tt>{v1.4.0}[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/tree/v1.4.0]</tt>.

=== Database

We recommend the use of MySQL in your application, since this gem is developed and tested using it.

== Installation

You can install the latest version of BigbluebuttonRails using RubyGems:

  gem install bigbluebutton_rails

Or simply add the following line in your Gemfile:

  gem "bigbluebutton_rails"

After installing, you need to run the generator:

  rails generate bigbluebutton_rails:install

This generator will create the files needed to setup the gem in your application.
You should take some time to open all the files generated and analyze them.

By default the gem will use the views it provides, <b>but it is strongly recommended that you adapt them for your needs!</b>
The views provided are just an example of how they can be implemented in your application and
they depend on jQuery (use the gem <tt>jquery-rails</tt>) and on a css file provided by this gem.
You can easily generate the views and the css file in your application to later customize them with:

  rails generate bigbluebutton_rails:views

To now more about the generators see {How to: Generators}[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/wiki/How-to:-Generators]

==== Dependencies

Since version 1.4.0, this gem depends on {Resque}[https://github.com/defunkt/resque], and since 2.0.0
it also uses {Resque-scheduler}[https://github.com/resque/resque-scheduler].

These gems are used to run background jobs. The ones we have right now are: update the list of recordings,
check for meetings that started or ended to update the database.

The gem already requires all dependencies, so you don't have to include them in your Gemfile. But you need
to configure your application to use Resque and Resque-scheduler.

To do so, copy the following files to your application:

* <tt>config/resque/resque.rake</tt> to your application's <tt>lib/tasks/</tt>;
* <tt>config/resque/workers_schedule.yml</tt> to your application's <tt>config/</tt>.

The first is a rake task to trigger Resque and Resque-scheduler. The second is the scheduling of tasks
used by Resque-scheduler. If you already use these gems in your application, you probably already have
these files. So you can just merge them together.

To run Resque and Resque-scheduler you will need to run the take tasks:

  QUEUE="bigbluebutton_rails" rake resque:work
  rake resque:scheduler


These gems use {redis}[http://redis.io/] to store their data, so you will need it in your server. If you're
on Ubuntu, you can install it with:

  apt-get install redis-server

Please refer to the documentation of {Resque}[https://github.com/defunkt/resque] and {Resque-scheduler}[https://github.com/resque/resque-scheduler] to learn more about them and how
to use them in development or production.


=== Routes

The routes to BigbluebuttonRails can be generated with the helper <tt>bigbluebutton_routes</tt>. See the example below:

  bigbluebutton_routes :default

It will generate the default routes. You need to call it at least once and the routes will be scoped with 'bigbluebutton'. They will look like:

  /bigbluebutton/servers
  /bigbluebutton/servers/my-server/new
  /bigbluebutton/servers/my-server/rooms
  /bigbluebutton/rooms
  /bigbluebutton/rooms/my-room/join

You can also make the routes use custom controllers:

  bigbluebutton_routes :default, :controllers => {
    :servers => 'custom_servers',
    :rooms => 'custom_rooms',
    :recordings => 'custom_recordings'
  }

To generate routes for a single controller:

  bigbluebutton_routes :default, :only => 'servers'

You may also want shorter routes to access conference rooms. For that, use the option <tt>room_matchers</tt>:

  resources :users do
    bigbluebutton_routes :room_matchers
  end

It creates routes to the actions used to access a conference room, so you can allow access to webconference rooms using URLs such as:

  http://myserver.com/my-community/room-name/join
  http://myserver.com/user-name/room-name/join

For more information see:

* {How to: Routes}[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/wiki/How-to:-Routes]

=== Basic configuration

There are some basic assumptions made by BigbluebuttonRails:

* You have a method called <tt>current_user</tt> that returns the current user;
* The <tt>current_user</tt> has an attribute or method called "name" that returns
  his/her fullname and an attribute or method "id" that returns the ID.

If you don't, you can change this behaviour easily, keep reading.

BigbluebuttonRails uses the methods <tt>bigbluebutton_user</tt> and <tt>bigbluebutton_role(room)</tt> to get the current user and to get the permission that the current
user has in the <tt>room</tt>, respectively. These methods are defined in {lib/bigbluebutton_rails/controller_methods.rb}[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/blob/master/lib/bigbluebutton_rails/controller_methods.rb]
and you can reimplement them in your application controller to change their behaviour as shown below.

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

    # overriding bigbluebutton_rails function
    def bigbluebutton_user
      current_user && current_user.is_a?(User) ? current_user : nil
    end

    def bigbluebutton_role(room)
      ...
    end

  end


=== Updating the recordings

Since this task can consume quite some time if your server has a lot of recordings,
it is recommended to run it periodically in the background. It is already done by the application
if you are running Resque and Resque-scheduler properly. But this gem also provides a rake task to
fetch the recordings from the web conference servers and update the application database.

The command below will fetch recordings for <b>all servers</b> and update the database
with all recordings found:

  rake bigbluebutton_rails:recordings:update

* {How recordings work}[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/wiki/How-Recordings-Work]


=== Updating the list of meetings

Meetings (<tt>BigbluebuttonMeeting</tt> models) in BigbluebuttonRails are instances of meetings that
were held in web conference rooms. A meeting is created whenever the application detects that a user
joined a room and that he's the first user. Meetings are never removed, they are kept as a registry
of what happened in the web conference servers connected to BigbluebuttonRails.

The creating of these objects is done in background using a gem called {resque}[https://github.com/defunkt/resque].
Whenever a user clicks in the button to join a meeting, a resque worker is scheduled. This worker
will wait for a while until the meeting is created and running in the web conference server, and
will then create the correponding <tt>BigbluebuttonMeeting</tt> object.

To keep track of meetings, you have to run the resque workers (this is needed both in development and in production):

  rake resque:work QUEUE='bigbluebutton_rails'

The list of meetings is also periodically synchronized using Resque-scheduler (see the sections above).


=== Example application

If you need more help to set up the gem or just want to see an example of it working,
check out the test application at <tt>spec/rails_app/</tt>!

== Contributing/Development

Fork this repository, clone your fork and start by installing the dependencies:

  bundle install

Note: if you're getting an error installing <tt>capybara-webkit</tt>, most likely you need to install QT, see: https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit

First copy <tt>spec/rails_app/config/database.yml.example</tt> to <tt>spec/rails_app/config/database.yml</tt>. It uses MySQL since this is the database recommended for the applications that use this gem. You have to set the appropriate password for your MySQL user.

Save <tt>spec/rails_app/features/config.yml.example</tt> as <tt>spec/rails_app/features/config.yml</tt> and edit it to set values for an existent BigBlueButton server. You will need it to run the integration tests. For more information see the page {Testing}[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails/wiki/Testing] in our wiki.

Prepare the <tt>rails_app</tt> used for tests:

  rake rails_app:install
  rake rails_app:db SERVER=my-server # select a server you defined in 'config.yml'
  rake rails_app:populate            # to create fake data, optional

Run the tests:

  rake spec
  rake cucumber SERVER=my-server

Or simply:

  rake SERVER=my-server

If you're adding migrations to the gem, test them with:

  rake spec:migrations

Note: If you don't set the SERVER variable, the first server in <tt>config.yml</tt> will be used.

You can also start the test application and navigate to <tt>localhost:3000</tt> to check it:

  cd spec/rails_app/
  rails server

If you need to keep track of meetings, run the resque workers with:

  rake resque:work QUEUE='bigbluebutton_rails'

Develop. :)
